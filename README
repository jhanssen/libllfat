LIBLLFAT
========

This is a library for low-level accessing a FAT12/16/32 filesystem. It offers
functions for reading and writing the basic elements of such filesystems such
as the number of sectors and the successor of a cluster, but also some more
complex operations such as looking up a file and defragmenting a filesystem.

See COPYING for licensing information.

Also see DISCLAIMER: this library has not been extensively tested, and some
operations may corrupt the filesystem it is operated upon to the point of
making recovery virtually impossible. The suggested application area of this
library is for filesystem images that can be easily recreated in case of such
failures.

Programs:

	fatview
		show the structure of a filesystem
	fattool
		various operations on a filesystem, such as reading and writing
		a cluster or a file, etc.
	fatbackup
		copy the essential parts of a filesystem
	fatshrink
		reduce the size of a filesystem
