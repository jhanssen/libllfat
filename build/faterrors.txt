# simulated errors
#
# read this file from a program:
#
#		fatsimulateinit();
#		fat_simulate_errors = fatsimulateread(filename, f.fd);
#
# format of each line:
#
#	READ/WRITE/SEEK number [sector/cluster [error/short]]
#
# READ/WRITE/SEEK	give error or seek, read, or write
#			multiple cases are allowed, like READ|WRITE
# number		the number of the sector or cluster
# sector/cluster	1 or CLUSTER = cluster (default)
#			0 or SECTOR = sector (the number is the absolute number
#			            of the sector in the filesystem, not within 
#				    the fat)
# error/short		-1 = operation fails (default)
#			>=0  short read or short write (only read or write)

# the library simulates a failure when attempting to read cluster 12
READ 12

# same when attempting to write cluster 5
WRITE 5

# both read and write, cluster 37
# READ|WRITE 37

# error on both read and write on sector 1
# READ|WRITE 1 SECTOR

# simulate a short read (100 bytes) when attempting to read sector 1
# READ 1 SECTOR 100

# read error on the boot sector; only works if fd=-1
# READ 0 SECTOR
