<h1>libllfat</h1>

<p>This is a library for low-level accessing a FAT12/16/32 filesystem. It
offers functions for reading and writing the basic elements of such filesystems
such as the number of sectors and the successor of a cluster, but also some
more complex operations such as looking up a file and defragmenting a
filesystem.</p>

<p>See COPYING for licensing information.</p>

<p>Also see DISCLAIMER: this library has not been extensively tested, and some
operations may corrupt the filesystem it is operated upon to the point of
making recovery virtually impossible. The suggested application area of this
library is for filesystem images that can be easily recreated in case of such
failures.</p>
