.SH NAME
fatshrink \- reduce the size of a FAT12/16/32 filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fatskrink
([-m] [-t])|[-f] device [sectors]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reduce the size of a FAT12/16/32 volume by removing the final part of it.
Depending on the options, clusters may be moved or files and directories
cut to make the filesystem fit the required size.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-m
move the clusters used to store data as the beginning of the volume, to free
the space at the end; this may allow shrinking filesystems while preserving
their content
.TP
-t
truncate the filesystem: if some clusters are in the area that is being cut out
(after moving them if -m was also specified), the files and directory using
them are truncated
.TP
-f
force: reduce the number of sectors without checking the current usage of
clusters; this leaves an incorrect filesystem if some clusters that are cut out
were in usage
.TP
device
the device or image to operate upon
.TP
sectors
the target number of sectors; if the operation is successful (it always is if
either -t or -f is given), the resulting filesystem has this number of sectors;
if omitted, the program prints the current number of sectors
