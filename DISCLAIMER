This library has NOT been extensively tested. Do not use it unless you have a
copy of all data in the filesystem it is run on.

While operations involving only reading data should be safe (but again, this is
cannot be told for sure so far), complex changes such as defragmenting might
garble the filesystem to the point of making recovery impossible. The suggested
application of such operations is on filesystem images that can be recreated in
case of failure.
